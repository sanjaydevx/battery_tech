## About
This project is a collection of source code artifacts related to Battery Management Systems (BMS).
Has a port of MATLAB model to Julia.

The MATLAB model has used two battery training datasets, one for Li-ion and one for a NMC cell.

The model uses the Cell Voltage, Current, Cell Temperature, Capacity and Energy to predict the SOC (state-of-charge) of the cell.

The MATLAB model used can be found here - https://www.sae.org/publications/technical-papers/content/2020-01-1181/
